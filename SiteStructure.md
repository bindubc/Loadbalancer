A well-structured repository for your hackathon project should be organized to clearly represent your solution, making it easy for others to understand and navigate. Below is an ideal structure that you can follow, along with a brief description of each folder and file:

### **1. Repository Structure:**

│   ├── cpu_monitor.sh
│   ├── delete_extra_vms.sh
│   └── linode_config.json
├── config
│   ├── nginx
│   │   ├── nginx.conf
│   │   └── ssl_cert.pem
│   ├── haproxy
│   │   └── haproxy.cfg
├── scripts
│   ├── update_lb_config.sh
│   └── failover_script.sh
├── monitoring

└── logs
    └── sample.log
```

### **2. Explanation of Each Folder and File:**

- **`README.md`**:
  - This file should provide an overview of the project. Include the problem statement, solution architecture, prerequisites, setup instructions, and how to use or run the scripts. Make sure to detail any configurations required and list the dependencies.

- **`scripts/`**:
  - Contains all the automation scripts for managing failover, dynamic scaling, and updating load balancer configurations.
  - **`update_lb_config.sh`**: Automatically updates the load balancer config when new VMs are created.
  - **`failover_script.sh`**: Script to handle failover between primary and secondary VMs.

- **`monitoring/`**:
  - Contains configuration files and scripts for setting up monitoring agents.
  - **`install_netdata.sh`**: Script to install Netdata for monitoring.
  - **`prometheus_config.yml`**: Configuration file for Prometheus if using it for monitoring.

- **`diagrams/`**:
  - Store architectural diagrams or any images that describe the project’s workflow.
  - **`architecture_diagram.png`**: Image file showing the high-level architecture of the load balancing and VM management solution.

- **`logs/`**:
  - Store sample log files for reference.
  - **`sample.log`**: A placeholder to show how logs are collected and managed.

### **3. Repository Example in `README.md`:**

Include the following sample structure and sections in your `README.md` file:

```markdown
# High Availability Load Balancer with Auto-Scaling

## Introduction
This project demonstrates setting up a high-availability load balancer using Linode VMs. It includes automated failover and dynamic VM creation when CPU utilization exceeds a threshold, ensuring that the system scales up during high traffic and scales down during low traffic.

## Architecture Overview
The architecture consists of:
- A primary load balancer that handles incoming traffic.
- A secondary load balancer for failover.
- Automated scripts that monitor CPU usage and create new VMs as needed.
- Secure configuration with SSL, VM hardening, and logging.

## Prerequisites
- Linode account with API access.
- Bash shell and `curl` installed.
- Basic knowledge of Nginx or HAProxy configuration.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Create Primary and Secondary VMs:**
   - Run the `create_linode_vm.sh` script to create the initial primary and secondary VMs.
   
2. **Configure the Load Balancer:**
   - Set up Nginx or HAProxy using the configuration files in the `config/` directory.

3. **Install Monitoring:**
   - Use the `monitoring/install_netdata.sh` script to set up Netdata or customize for Prometheus.

4. **Automate Scaling:**
   - Schedule the `cpu_monitor.sh` script using Cron to monitor CPU and trigger scaling.

## Usage Guide
- To start monitoring:
  ```bash
  ./infrastructure/cpu_monitor.sh
  ```
- To manually create a new VM:
  ```bash
  ./infrastructure/create_linode_vm.sh
  ```
- To update load balancer configuration:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/update_lb_config.sh
  ```

### **4. Version Control and Branching Strategy:**

- **`main`**: The main branch containing the final, stable version.
- **`dev`**: A development branch for implementing and testing new features.
- **`feature/<feature-name>`**: For specific features like `feature/add-autoscaling` or `feature/loadbalancer-config`.
