The error message indicates that the permissions of the directory `/var/log/` are not secure, which prevents `logrotate` from managing the HAProxy logs correctly. To resolve this issue, you can update the permissions of the directory and add the `su` directive to your logrotate configuration. Hereâ€™s how to handle this:

### Solution 1: Fix Directory Permissions
1. **Check Directory Permissions:**

   Verify the current permissions of the `/var/log/` directory:

   ```bash
   ls -ld /var/log/
   ```

   The permissions should look like this: `drwxr-xr-x` or `755`. If they are more permissive, such as `drwxrwxrwx` (777), it could cause the issue.

2. **Modify Directory Permissions:**

   Change the permissions to `755` to ensure that only the root user has write access:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 755 /var/log/
   ```

3. **Check Permissions for the Log File:**

   Ensure that the `haproxy.log` file itself has secure permissions:

   ```bash
   sudo chown root:adm /var/log/haproxy.log
   sudo chmod 640 /var/log/haproxy.log
   ```

   This will set the correct ownership (`root` user and `adm` group) and restrict permissions to allow read/write access only to the owner and group members.

### Solution 2: Use the `su` Directive in Logrotate
If changing directory permissions is not an option or does not resolve the issue, add the `su` directive to your `logrotate` configuration for HAProxy:

1. **Edit Logrotate Configuration for HAProxy:**

   Open the `logrotate` configuration file for HAProxy:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/haproxy
   ```

2. **Add the `su` Directive:**

   Modify the configuration as follows to specify the correct user and group for `logrotate`:

   ```bash
   /var/log/haproxy.log {
       daily
       missingok
       rotate 1
       compress
       delaycompress
       notifempty
       create 640 root adm
       su root adm
       postrotate
           /usr/bin/systemctl reload haproxy > /dev/null 2>/dev/null || true
       endscript
   }
   ```

   The `su root adm` directive ensures that `logrotate` uses the correct permissions when handling HAProxy logs. It specifies that `logrotate` should switch to the `root` user and `adm` group during rotation.

### Solution 3: Check Parent Directory Permissions
If you encounter the issue again, check for other parent directories of `/var/log/haproxy.log` to ensure that none are world-writable or have inappropriate permissions:

```bash
ls -ld / /var /var/log
```

Each directory should have permissions similar to:

- `/` should be `drwxr-xr-x` (755)
- `/var` should be `drwxr-xr-x` (755)
- `/var/log` should be `drwxr-xr-x` (755)

### Final Step: Verify Logrotate
After applying the changes, manually test `logrotate` again:

```bash
sudo logrotate -f /etc/logrotate.d/haproxy
```

If there are no errors, the configuration should be functioning correctly, and logs will be rotated daily with logs older than 1 day purged automatically. Let me know if this resolves your issue or if further troubleshooting is needed!
