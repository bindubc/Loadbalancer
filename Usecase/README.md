For the  project on creating a high-availability public-facing load balancer using Linode VMs, the following use cases will cover key scenarios that ensure proposed  solution meets the requirements and addresses typical situations encountered in load balancing and high availability setups.

### **Use Cases for High Availability Load Balancer**

1. **High CPU Utilization: Automatically Spin Up a New VM**
   - **Description**: When the primary load balancer’s CPU usage crosses 80%, the system automatically triggers the creation of a new Linode VM to handle increased traffic.
   - **Precondition**: The load balancer is currently handling a high volume of requests.
   - **Trigger**: CPU utilization crosses 80%.
   - **Expected Outcome**: A new VM is spun up, and the load balancer configuration is updated to include the new server.

2. **Traffic Failover: Automatic Switching between Primary and Secondary Load Balancers**
   - **Description**: If the primary load balancer goes down or becomes unresponsive, traffic is automatically redirected to the secondary load balancer.
   - **Precondition**: Primary load balancer is active, and the secondary load balancer is set up as a backup.
   - **Trigger**: Health check failure or no response from the primary load balancer.
   - **Expected Outcome**: All incoming traffic is directed to the secondary load balancer without downtime.

3. **Graceful HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**
   - **Description**: When a user accesses the application over HTTP (port 80), the system gracefully redirects the request to HTTPS (port 443).
   - **Precondition**: The load balancer should be configured with SSL certificates for HTTPS.
   - **Trigger**: User tries to access the application over HTTP.
   - **Expected Outcome**: The user is seamlessly redirected to the secure HTTPS URL.

4. **Handling 50,000 Concurrent Connections**
   - **Description**: The load balancer should handle up to 50,000 concurrent connections without performance degradation.
   - **Precondition**: A large number of clients connect simultaneously.
   - **Trigger**: High traffic scenario such as a flash sale or event launch.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Load balancer maintains performance and successfully distributes connections across multiple VMs.

5. **Logging and Monitoring of Load Balancer Activities**
   - **Description**: All activities and traffic logs are captured for monitoring and troubleshooting.
   - **Precondition**: Logging and monitoring tools (Netdata, Prometheus) are set up on the VMs.
   - **Trigger**: Any request or response to and from the load balancer.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Logs are stored for at least 1 day and old logs are purged as defined.

6. **VM Hardening: Security Configuration of Load Balancer VM**
   - **Description**: Implement security best practices on the load balancer VMs to protect against attacks.
   - **Precondition**: The VM has been freshly deployed.
   - **Trigger**: New VM creation or configuration change.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Security measures such as disabling unused ports, applying firewall rules, and configuring SSH keys are implemented.

7. **Dynamic Layer 4 and Layer 7 Rule Management**
   - **Description**: Programmatically define and update rules based on the application’s requirements, including IP-based filtering (Layer 4) and session management (Layer 7).
   - **Precondition**: An API or configuration file is available to update load balancer rules.
   - **Trigger**: Security or application-specific rule changes.
   - **Expected Outcome**: New rules are applied dynamically without restarting the load balancer.

8. **Programmatic Interaction using Linode API**
   - **Description**: Automate infrastructure management (e.g., spinning up/down VMs, updating DNS) using Linode API calls.
   - **Precondition**: Linode API tokens are configured.
   - **Trigger**: A script or automation tool invokes the API for changes.
   - **Expected Outcome**: New VMs are created, updated, or deleted based on API calls, and configurations are modified programmatically.

9. **Real-Time Health Monitoring and Notification System**
   - **Description**: Continuously monitor the health of the load balancer and backend VMs and send alerts if any node becomes unhealthy.
   - **Precondition**: Monitoring and alerting system is set up (e.g., Netdata with email/Slack integration).
   - **Trigger**: Health check failure or node becomes unresponsive.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Alert notifications are sent, and health status is logged.

10. **Load Balancer Scaling Down when CPU Usage Drops**
    - **Description**: When CPU utilization falls below a specified threshold (e.g., 30%), the system should spin down additional VMs to save resources.
    - **Precondition**: Multiple VMs are active, handling lower traffic.
    - **Trigger**: CPU utilization is consistently below 30% for a defined period.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Extra VMs are shut down, and the load balancer configuration is updated accordingly.

11. **SSL Certificate Renewal Automation**
    - **Description**: SSL certificates should be automatically renewed using tools like Let’s Encrypt or Certbot.
    - **Precondition**: The current SSL certificate is nearing expiration.
    - **Trigger**: Certificate expiry within 30 days.
    - **Expected Outcome**: The certificate is automatically renewed without manual intervention and with zero downtime.

12. **Layer 4 and Layer 7 Security Rules Enforcement**
    - **Description**: Apply security rules to filter traffic based on IP addresses (Layer 4) and ensure session management (Layer 7).
    - **Precondition**: Rules are defined in the configuration files.
    - **Trigger**: Security policy change.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Requests are allowed or denied based on predefined rules, and session management is enforced.

### **Bonus Use Case: Implementing Canary Deployment for Feature Testing**
- **Description**: When a new feature is deployed, route only 10% of the traffic to the new VM to test stability.
- **Precondition**: New VM with the updated feature is deployed.
- **Trigger**: New feature deployment.
- **Expected Outcome**: Traffic is split between the stable and new feature VM, and logs are analyzed to validate stability.

These use cases should comprehensively cover the functional and non-functional requirements for your project. Let me know if you'd like to add or refine any use cases!
