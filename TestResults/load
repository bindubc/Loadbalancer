### **Load and Stress Test Cases for High Availability Load Balancer**

Load and stress testing are crucial to evaluate how the load balancer performs under heavy traffic and extreme conditions. These tests ensure the system can handle high traffic volumes, recover from failures, and remain stable during peak loads.

#### **1. Load Test: Handling 50,000 Concurrent Connections**
- **Test ID**: LT001
- **Description**: Verify that the load balancer can handle 50,000 concurrent connections as required.
- **Precondition**: Multiple backend VMs are set up and connected to the load balancer.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use a traffic generation tool (e.g., `siege`, `wrk`, or `Apache JMeter`) to generate 50,000 concurrent connections.
  2. Monitor the load balancer’s CPU, memory, and response times during the test.
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer efficiently distributes traffic across backend VMs, maintaining low response times, and CPU usage does not exceed 80%.

#### **2. Load Test: Sustained Traffic for 24 Hours**
- **Test ID**: LT002
- **Description**: Test how the load balancer performs under sustained traffic over an extended period (24 hours).
- **Precondition**: Monitoring tools are set up to track performance metrics over time.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate continuous traffic for 24 hours using a tool like `wrk` or `Apache JMeter`.
  2. Monitor system performance metrics like CPU utilization, memory, and network bandwidth.
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer remains stable, with no significant degradation in performance, and handles traffic without errors.

#### **3. Stress Test: Sudden Spike in Traffic (Flash Crowd)**
- **Test ID**: ST001
- **Description**: Test how the load balancer reacts to a sudden increase in traffic (e.g., a 10x increase within a few seconds).
- **Precondition**: Monitoring tools are in place to capture CPU, memory, and network usage.
- **Steps**:
  1. Gradually increase traffic by 10x within a short time (e.g., 5 seconds) using `wrk` or `Apache JMeter`.
  2. Monitor load balancer response times and resource consumption.
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer should handle the spike without crashing or degrading performance. If CPU exceeds 80%, new VMs should automatically be spun up.

#### **4. Stress Test: Extreme Load with Failure of Primary Load Balancer**
- **Test ID**: ST002
- **Description**: Simulate a failure of the primary load balancer under extreme load to test if the secondary load balancer takes over gracefully.
- **Precondition**: Primary and secondary load balancers are configured for failover.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate traffic close to the maximum supported by the load balancer (e.g., 60,000 concurrent connections).
  2. Manually disable or stop the primary load balancer while the test is running.
  3. Observe whether the secondary load balancer takes over and continues to handle the traffic.
- **Expected Outcome**: The secondary load balancer should take over with minimal downtime, and traffic should continue to be handled without errors.

#### **5. Load Test: Traffic Distribution Across Backend VMs**
- **Test ID**: LT003
- **Description**: Verify that traffic is evenly distributed across multiple backend VMs under high load.
- **Precondition**: Backend VMs are configured with a load-balancing algorithm (e.g., round-robin or least connections).
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate a high volume of traffic (e.g., 40,000 concurrent connections) using `wrk` or `Apache JMeter`.
  2. Monitor traffic distribution across all backend VMs.
- **Expected Outcome**: Traffic is evenly distributed across backend VMs, with no single VM receiving a disproportionately high number of requests.

#### **6. Stress Test: Maximum Concurrent Connection Limit**
- **Test ID**: ST003
- **Description**: Test the behavior of the load balancer when the number of concurrent connections exceeds its specified limit (e.g., 55,000 connections).
- **Precondition**: Load balancer should be configured with a connection limit (e.g., 50,000 connections).
- **Steps**:
  1. Gradually increase the number of concurrent connections above the load balancer’s specified limit using a traffic simulation tool.
  2. Monitor system behavior, including how excess connections are handled.
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer should either reject excess connections gracefully or queue them, without crashing. It should still handle the maximum allowed connections efficiently.

#### **7. Load Test: Impact of HTTPS Overhead**
- **Test ID**: LT004
- **Description**: Evaluate the load balancer’s performance when handling HTTPS requests compared to HTTP, due to the additional encryption/decryption overhead.
- **Precondition**: SSL certificates are deployed and traffic generators are configured to send both HTTP and HTTPS requests.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate high traffic (e.g., 40,000 concurrent connections) with HTTP requests.
  2. Monitor the performance of the load balancer (CPU, memory, and response times).
  3. Repeat the test with HTTPS requests.
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer should handle HTTPS requests with minimal performance degradation, and the CPU should not exceed 80%.

#### **8. Stress Test: Continuous Failover Testing**
- **Test ID**: ST004
- **Description**: Test how the system handles continuous failovers between primary and secondary load balancers under heavy load.
- **Precondition**: Primary and secondary load balancers are configured for automatic failover.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate high traffic (e.g., 30,000 concurrent connections).
  2. Manually failover between primary and secondary load balancers multiple times during the test.
  3. Monitor response times and system behavior.
- **Expected Outcome**: The system should handle continuous failovers without downtime or performance degradation.

#### **9. Load Test: Handling Large Payloads**
- **Test ID**: LT005
- **Description**: Test the load balancer’s ability to handle a large number of requests with large payloads (e.g., file uploads).
- **Precondition**: Backend VMs are configured to accept large payloads.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate a large number of requests with payloads exceeding a specific size (e.g., 10MB per request).
  2. Monitor system behavior and resource consumption (CPU, memory, and network bandwidth).
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer handles large payloads efficiently without excessive resource consumption or errors.

#### **10. Stress Test: Load Balancer Recovery from Failure**
- **Test ID**: ST005
- **Description**: Test the load balancer’s ability to recover from a crash or failure while under heavy load.
- **Precondition**: Load balancer is under heavy traffic.
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate a crash or failure of the load balancer while it is handling high traffic.
  2. Monitor the time it takes for the load balancer to recover and resume normal operation.
- **Expected Outcome**: The load balancer should recover from failure within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 30 seconds), and traffic should resume without significant impact on end-users.
