### **Test Cases for High Availability Load Balancer Setup**

Each of these test cases corresponds to a particular use case and is intended to verify specific functionalities and behaviors of the load balancer solution. The test cases ensure that the solution is reliable, scalable, and secure.

---

#### **1. Test Case: Automatic VM Creation on High CPU Utilization**
- **Test ID**: TC001
- **Description**: Verify that a new VM is spun up when the primary load balancer’s CPU usage crosses 80%.
- **Precondition**: Load balancer should have the ability to monitor CPU utilization.
- **Steps**:
  1. Simulate high traffic to increase CPU utilization above 80%.
  2. Observe the load balancer’s reaction.
- **Expected Outcome**: A new VM is created, and traffic is balanced between the primary and the new VM.

#### **2. Test Case: Failover to Secondary Load Balancer on Primary Failure**
- **Test ID**: TC002
- **Description**: Verify that the traffic is redirected to the secondary load balancer if the primary load balancer becomes unresponsive.
- **Precondition**: Both primary and secondary load balancers are configured.
- **Steps**:
  1. Stop or disable the primary load balancer.
  2. Send traffic to the load balancer IP.
- **Expected Outcome**: Traffic is routed to the secondary load balancer without downtime.

#### **3. Test Case: HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**
- **Test ID**: TC003
- **Description**: Verify that the load balancer correctly redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
- **Precondition**: Load balancer should be configured with SSL certificates.
- **Steps**:
  1. Send a request to the load balancer over HTTP (`http://<loadbalancer_ip>`).
  2. Observe the response.
- **Expected Outcome**: Request is redirected to `https://<loadbalancer_ip>`.

#### **4. Test Case: Handling 50,000 Concurrent Connections**
- **Test ID**: TC004
- **Description**: Verify that the load balancer can handle up to 50,000 concurrent connections.
- **Precondition**: Multiple backend VMs should be set up and linked to the load balancer.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use a traffic simulation tool (e.g., `siege` or `wrk`) to generate 50,000 concurrent connections.
  2. Monitor the load balancer’s response.
- **Expected Outcome**: All 50,000 connections are handled without performance degradation or errors.

#### **5. Test Case: Log Retention and Purging**
- **Test ID**: TC005
- **Description**: Verify that logs are retained for 1 day and older logs are automatically purged.
- **Precondition**: Logging mechanism is configured.
- **Steps**:
  1. Generate traffic and activities for 2 days.
  2. Check the logs on the load balancer VM.
- **Expected Outcome**: Logs older than 1 day should be deleted.

#### **6. Test Case: VM Security Hardening**
- **Test ID**: TC006
- **Description**: Verify that all security configurations (disabling unused ports, applying firewall rules) are applied to the load balancer VM.
- **Precondition**: A new VM is spun up with a security configuration script.
- **Steps**:
  1. Deploy a new VM.
  2. Check open ports and firewall rules.
- **Expected Outcome**: Only necessary ports (443, 22) should be open, and SSH access should be restricted.

---

#### **7. Test Case: Dynamic Layer 4 and Layer 7 Rule Management**
- **Test ID**: TC007
- **Description**: Verify that the load balancer can dynamically update rules based on IP address (Layer 4) and session management (Layer 7).
- **Precondition**: An API or configuration tool is available for rule updates.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define a new IP blocking rule at Layer 4.
  2. Test with a request from the blocked IP.
  3. Define a session stickiness rule at Layer 7.
  4. Send multiple requests from the same session.
- **Expected Outcome**: The IP is blocked, and the session stickiness rule is enforced.

---

#### **8. Test Case: Programmatic Interaction using Linode API**
- **Test ID**: TC008
- **Description**: Verify that the load balancer and VM infrastructure can be managed using Linode APIs.
- **Precondition**: Linode API tokens are set up and configured.
- **Steps**:
  1. Make an API call to create a new VM.
  2. Check the load balancer configuration.
- **Expected Outcome**: A new VM is created, and configurations are updated.

---

#### **9. Test Case: Real-Time Health Monitoring and Alerting**
- **Test ID**: TC009
- **Description**: Verify that health monitoring tools send alerts when a VM becomes unresponsive.
- **Precondition**: Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus) and alerting channels (email/Slack) are configured.
- **Steps**:
  1. Disable one of the backend VMs.
  2. Monitor the health status and alert logs.
- **Expected Outcome**: An alert is sent, and health status is logged.

---

#### **10. Test Case: Automatic VM Shutdown on Low CPU Utilization**
- **Test ID**: TC010
- **Description**: Verify that the load balancer automatically shuts down additional VMs when CPU usage drops below a defined threshold (e.g., 30%).
- **Precondition**: Multiple VMs are handling traffic.
- **Steps**:
  1. Reduce traffic to decrease CPU utilization.
  2. Monitor the behavior of the load balancer.
- **Expected Outcome**: Extra VMs are spun down, and the load balancer configuration is updated.

---

#### **11. Test Case: SSL Certificate Renewal Automation**
- **Test ID**: TC011
- **Description**: Verify that SSL certificates are renewed automatically using Let’s Encrypt.
- **Precondition**: SSL certificates are close to expiration.
- **Steps**:
  1. Check the current SSL certificate expiration date.
  2. Wait for the automatic renewal script to run.
- **Expected Outcome**: A new SSL certificate is applied without manual intervention.

---

#### **12. Test Case: Canary Deployment for Feature Testing**
- **Test ID**: TC012
- **Description**: Verify that traffic can be split between the stable and new feature version for canary testing.
- **Precondition**: A new VM with a different version of the application is deployed.
- **Steps**:
  1. Configure the load balancer to route 10% of traffic to the new VM.
  2. Send multiple requests.
- **Expected Outcome**: 10% of the traffic is handled by the new VM, and the rest goes to the stable version.
