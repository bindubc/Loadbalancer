Here’s a step-by-step approach to get started with your load balancer setup:

### 1. **Create the Primary and Secondary Linode VMs:**
   - Log in to your Linode account and create **two separate VMs** to act as the primary and secondary load balancers.
   - Choose a suitable operating system (e.g., Ubuntu) and size that supports the required load.

### 2. **Install and Configure Nginx or HAProxy:**
   - For a high-availability load balancer, use **HAProxy** or **Nginx**. These tools support SSL termination, Layer 4/7 rules, and health checks.
   - **Install Nginx** on both VMs:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install nginx -y
     ```
   - Alternatively, install **HAProxy**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install haproxy -y
     ```

### 3. **Set Up SSL for HTTPS Traffic (Port 443):**
   - Use **Let's Encrypt** to generate SSL certificates.
   - Install the Certbot utility for Let's Encrypt:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
     ```
   - Obtain the SSL certificate and auto-renewal:
     ```bash
     sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
     ```
   - This will configure the SSL certificate on **Port 443** and set up automated renewal.

### 4. **Redirect HTTP (Port 80) to HTTPS:**
   - Add the following to your **Nginx** configuration file (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`) to redirect HTTP traffic:
     ```nginx
     server {
         listen 80;
         server_name yourdomain.com;
         return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
     }
     ```
   - This ensures all HTTP connections are redirected to HTTPS.

### 5. **Configure Load Balancing Rules:**
   - If using **HAProxy**, configure rules in `/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`:
     ```haproxy
     frontend http_front
         bind *:443 ssl crt /etc/ssl/certs/yourdomain.pem
         default_backend servers

     backend servers
         balance roundrobin
         server server1 192.168.1.2:80 check
         server server2 192.168.1.3:80 check
     ```
   - For **Nginx**, add the following to your configuration file:
     ```nginx
     upstream backend {
         server 192.168.1.2;
         server 192.168.1.3;
     }

     server {
         listen 443 ssl;
         ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
         ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;
         location / {
             proxy_pass http://backend;
         }
     }
     ```

### 6. **Implement Health Checks:**
   - Add health checks in **HAProxy**:
     ```haproxy
     option httpchk HEAD / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:localhost
     ```
   - In **Nginx**, use the **`proxy_pass`** directive and monitor the upstream servers.

### 7. **Set Up Failover:**
   - Use **Keepalived** for automatic failover between the primary and secondary load balancers.
   - Install Keepalived:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install keepalived -y
     ```
   - Configure a **virtual IP (VIP)** for automatic failover between the two load balancers using `/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf`.

### 8. **Enable Logging and Log Management:**
   - Ensure that access and error logs are configured in both Nginx/HAProxy.
   - For Nginx, add this inside the server block:
     ```nginx
     access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log;
     error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log;
     ```
   - Set up a log rotation using **Logrotate** or a centralized logging solution like **ELK Stack**.

### 9. **Secure the Load Balancer (VM Hardening):**
   - Implement VM hardening by disabling unused services and ports.
   - Use **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** to restrict access:
     ```bash
     sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
     sudo ufw deny 80/tcp
     sudo ufw enable
     ```
   - Set up SSH key-based authentication and disable root login for security.

### 10. **Programmatic Control Using Linode API:**
   - Use the [Linode API](https://www.linode.com/docs/api/) to automate load balancer creation, deletion, or configuration.
   - Install `curl` or `requests` in Python to interact with the API.

### 11. **Test and Verify:**
   - Test for 50,000 concurrent connections using **Apache JMeter** or similar tools.
   - Verify failover by shutting down one VM and checking if traffic is smoothly redirected to the secondary.
