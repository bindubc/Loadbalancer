To deploy a high availability load balancer on Linode, you'll need to perform several configuration steps, including setting up the VMs, configuring load balancing software, securing the setup, and ensuring high availability through automated failover mechanisms. Below is a step-by-step guide for deploying and configuring the environment on Linode.

### **Step-by-Step Deployment Guide for High Availability Load Balancer on Linode**

---

### **1. Initial Setup and Prerequisites**

- **Create a Linode Account**: If you don’t have an account, create one at [Linode](https://www.linode.com).
- **Deploy Linode VMs**: Create multiple VMs for primary and secondary load balancers and backend servers.
  - **Minimum VMs**:
    - **1 Primary Load Balancer**
    - **1 Secondary Load Balancer** (for failover)
    - **2+ Backend Servers** (to distribute load)
- **Install and Configure a Load Balancer Software**: Use popular load balancer tools like:
  - **NGINX** or **HAProxy** for Layer 4 and Layer 7 load balancing.
  - **Keepalived** or **Pacemaker** for automated failover between load balancers.

- **Generate SSH Keys** for secure VM access:
  - If you don’t have a key pair, generate one using:
    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
    ```
  - Add the public key to your Linode VMs during deployment.

### **2. Deploy and Configure Load Balancer VMs**

#### **a. Set Up Primary Load Balancer VM**
1. **Install NGINX or HAProxy**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install nginx -y
   ```
   For HAProxy:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install haproxy -y
   ```

2. **Configure NGINX for HTTPS and Load Balancing**:
   - Open the NGINX configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
     ```
   - Replace the configuration with a load balancing setup:
     ```nginx
     http {
         upstream backend_servers {
             server backend_server_1_IP;
             server backend_server_2_IP;
         }

         server {
             listen 80;
             server_name your_domain.com;
             return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
         }

         server {
             listen 443 ssl;
             server_name your_domain.com;

             ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
             ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;

             location / {
                 proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
                 proxy_set_header Host $host;
                 proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
                 proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
             }
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Create SSL Certificates** (Optional for testing):
   - Generate self-signed certificates:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
     sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
         -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key \
         -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt
     ```

4. **Restart NGINX**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

5. **Set Up Health Checks and Logging**:
   - Ensure the load balancer is configured to log traffic and health-check backend servers.

#### **b. Set Up Secondary Load Balancer VM**
- **Repeat the same configuration as the primary** load balancer.
- Ensure configurations are identical for high availability.

---

### **3. Configure High Availability and Failover with Keepalived**

1. **Install Keepalived on Both Load Balancers**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install keepalived -y
   ```

2. **Configure Keepalived on Primary Load Balancer**:
   - Create a Keepalived configuration file:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
     ```
   - Add the following configuration:
     ```conf
     vrrp_instance VI_1 {
         state MASTER
         interface eth0
         virtual_router_id 51
         priority 100
         advert_int 1
         authentication {
             auth_type PASS
             auth_pass 1234
         }
         virtual_ipaddress {
             <your_virtual_ip_address>
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Configure Keepalived on Secondary Load Balancer**:
   - Change `state` to `BACKUP` and `priority` to a lower value (e.g., 90).

4. **Start Keepalived**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start keepalived
   ```
   - The primary load balancer will automatically handle traffic using the virtual IP address.
   - If the primary fails, the secondary will take over.

### **4. Programmatic Scaling Based on CPU Usage**

#### **Set Up CPU Monitoring and Automated Scaling**

1. **Install Cloud Monitoring Tools**:
   - Use a monitoring tool like **Prometheus** or **Node Exporter** to track CPU usage.

2. **Create a Script for Automated VM Provisioning**:
   - Use Linode’s API to automate scaling. Below is an example using the `linode-cli`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   CPU_USAGE=$(grep 'cpu ' /proc/stat | awk '{usage=($2+$4)*100/($2+$4+$5)} END {print usage}')
   if [ $(echo "$CPU_USAGE > 80" | bc) -ne 0 ]; then
       # Spin up a new Linode VM when CPU exceeds 80%
       linode-cli linodes create --image linode/ubuntu20.04 --root_pass mypassword --label "additional-lb"
   fi
   ```

3. **Set Up a Cron Job** to Run the Script Regularly:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   - Add the following line:
     ```bash
     */5 * * * * /path_to_script/cpu_monitor.sh
     ```

4. **Configure NGINX/HAProxy to Add New Backend VMs**:
   - Use NGINX’s dynamic upstream module or reconfigure HAProxy to add new backends programmatically.

---

### **5. Testing and Verification**

- **Verify SSL Deployment**: Test if the load balancer properly serves HTTPS traffic.
- **Test Load Balancing**: Generate traffic using tools like `Apache JMeter` to test the distribution.
- **Check Failover**: Manually disable the primary load balancer and verify if the secondary takes over.
- **Perform Load and Stress Testing**: Use the test cases defined earlier.
